This repository contains the data and code I use to perform a spatial analysis of the locations of battery electric vehicle charging stations. My results are written in "SpatialAnalysisChargingStations.Rmd". The abstract for my final paper is below:

"Current literature suggests that the locations of battery electric vehicle (BEV) charging stations in the state of California may depend on the distribution of wealth, political ideologies, and race demographics across the state. To better understand this dependency, I perform both an areal and a point process analysis of data comprised of the locations of BEV charging stations in California and the aggregated wealth characteristics, political ideologies, and race demographics of census tracts and counties in the state. For both analyses, I test for complete spatial randomness in the distribution of charging stations. After finding evidence against spatial randomness, I use a spatial Durbin model (for the areal analysis) and a nonhomogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP) model (for the point process analysis) to describe the distribution of charging stations. Both models indicate that wealthier, more populated regions of California with higher proportions of residents identifying as Black and higher proportions of residents identifying as Democrats tend to have more BEV charging stations."
